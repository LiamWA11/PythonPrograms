MathPrac is a stand alone Python Prgram for practicing simple mathematics. You can customize
MathPrac to make the sums as hard or as easy as you want.

It has been written in an object orientated programming language called 'Python'. MathPrac
has been written in Microsoft VisualStudio using Visual Python 3.3.

MathPrac has been written by a Year Seven Student at Seton Catholic College, Perth, Western
Australia, Australia.

His motivation for this project was his love of computer science and Mathematics. He was 
being bored to death in Mathemetics because of his intelectual capabilites in all Academic 
Studies. He decided, that he would write a program to both test his programming skills and
to allow him to practice more complicated mathematics without having to rely on some other
program.

The result was amazing, Right now it is in early Alpha, version 0.01. It has been made over
the course of 7 days, 5 of which were spent at school.

So far, MathPrac features the ability to create sums that have customizable numbers, but
only has the functionality for two numbered sums at the moment. Once you have picked two
numbers, MathPrac will pick two random numbers in between those numbers that you specified.
After that it will ask you how many questions you would like to have, it ranges from 2 to
infinity, so be careful. MathPrac will then randomly pick an operation for the sums.
